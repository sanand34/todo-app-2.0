### Setup Instructions

#### System setup
1. Clone the repo with `git clone [REPO_URL]` command
2. Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Once, 'npm install' is completed, run `exp start` to start the expo and react-native server
5. If it shows a QR code on the terminal as a result of 'exp start' command, then you are good to go!

you can write your env specific config variables on `.env` file and import them from `react-native-dotenv` package as mentioned [here](https://github.com/zetachang/react-native-dotenv#usage).

Ignore the first step on 'Mobile setup' instructions given below if you already have 'Expo' app installed on your phone.

#### Mobile setup
1. Install 'Expo' application on your android/iOS device. You can find the links to Android and iOS apps [here](https://expo.io/tools#client).
2. Scan the QR code shown on the terminal.
3. Once the QR code is successfully scanned, it will take few seconds to load and render the app.

#### Linter git-hook setup
1. Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
2. Run the following command to copy the git hook from 'git-hooks' to '.git/hooks' directory
  `cp git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/`
3. Run the following command to make the hook executable.
  `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

**Note** This git hook runs everytime you commit. It won't let the developer commit the code if there is any eslint issue on the files changed.
